# segmentation-cluster-analysis
This repository contains the data analysis and presentation materials for Harvard Business Case Study conducted on Sticks Kebob Shop (link-https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/UV7031-PDF-ENG). The case study focuses on customer segmentation using cluster analysis to guide strategic decisions for business expansion.

## Project Description

The analysis involves the application of cluster analysis techniques such as K-means clustreing and  Hierarchical clustering to customer survey data to identify distinct segments that exhibit unique characteristics and preferences. This strategic insight is aimed at optimizing Sticks Kebob Shop's expansion by targeting customer segments most likely to benefit from specific business strategies.

## Learnings from Cluster Analysis
Through the cluster analysis conducted in this case study, several key learnings were uncovered that can significantly impact business strategy:

**Customer Segmentation**: We identified distinct segments within the customer base, each with unique characteristics and preferences. This allows for more targeted marketing and service strategies.
**Data Insights**: The analysis provided deep insights into customer behavior, including preferences for menu items, pricing sensitivity, and frequency of visits.
**Strategic Decision Making**: Utilizing cluster analysis helped in making informed decisions regarding location expansion, menu customization, and marketing campaigns.
**Technical Skills**: The project enhanced our proficiency in using R for statistical analysis and Python for data cleaning, providing a robust skill set for future data science projects.
